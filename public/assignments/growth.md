# Exercise: Growth

#### Duration: 
25 minutes 

#### Brief: 
Create a single page site that grows, blooms, wilts, and then disappears. 

### Helpful Hints: 
- Use `setInterval` to introduce a steady cadence to your site.
- Use a global variable to keep track of how long your animation has been going for.
- Use `if(){ }else if(){ }else{ }` to divide your sections into growth, blooming, and wilting.
- Try using javascript generated inline css for attributes like `width`, `height`, or colors like `rgb()`
- Try adding and subtracting classes to add/remove fixed styles.
- Try writing out the different steps in pseudo-code. Try identifying the parts that you could swap out for actual code. Try rewriting the parts you can&rsquo;t into smaller sentences.
