# Part 2: New York Commercial Vehicle Typography

- [TruckLife are.na channel](https://www.are.na/ben-ross-1515211424/trucklife)

For next week (February 24th), you will introduce two `@media` query breakpoints and a CSS animation to your truck.

To start, please make a copy of your Commercial Vehicle assignment from last week. You will use this  as a working copy for this week so that we have a before and an after copy. 

## Requirements
Your assignment should: 
- have at least two `@media` queries, allowing your truck to successfully transition between different widths


## Helpful Tips
- You can preview your site&rsquo;s mobile experience with `cmd` + `alt` + `i` and selecting the iphone/tablet icon in the inspector
- CSS reads from top to bottom: this means any media query may be overwritten by styles written further down the document.

## Submission/Uploading
Once you are ready to upload your assignment to the class server, make sure to make a *new* folder inside `your-name/projects` titled `truck2` to put this week&rsquo;s work into.
