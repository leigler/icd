# Part 3: New York Commercial Vehicle Typography (Exercise)

- [TruckLife are.na channel](https://www.are.na/ben-ross-1515211424/trucklife)


As an exercise, introduce a CSS animation to your Commercial Vehicle. The implementation (duration, scale, speed, iteration) of this animation is up to you: it can be used to load your vehicle in, depict time of day, activate on `:hover`, or highlight some feature of your vehicle.


## Submission/Uploading
Once you are ready to upload your assignment to the class server, make sure to make a *new* folder inside `your-name/projects` titled `truck3` to put this week&rsquo;s work into.
