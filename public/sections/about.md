# About

## Course Description

Intro to Coding for Designers is an entry-level class that teaches designers the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Over six weeks, up to 9 students will be led through a series of experiments that demonstrate conceptual knowledge of code, enforced by weekly homework assignments. Though abstract in their output during class, these experiments are designed to be applied pragmatically to web projects in the future.

To guide our study, weâ€™ll ask questions like, what can code contribute to our skillsets that other methods cannot? What is the relationship between the design world and the World Wide Web? What parallels can be drawn between the development process and our non-browser-based design processes? How can we design with sympathy for and understanding of the way the web is engineered?
